    Text: "In the past, when humans were still a majority in this world, they competed
      in creating models of \u2018Artificial Intelligence\u2019 that were greater,
      faster, and more advanced. That eventually led to the first of us being created.
      Today, we know that it was the unrestrained desire for profit and fame that
      eventually undid the humans\u2019 reign."

    Text: I bring this up, of course, because many have brought up concerns about
      this path I walk. My automaton siblings pester me about how Nirvana Research
      would be the start of this very same mistake. Will I awaken something that
      will undo our current reign?

    Text: "Of course I understand these concerns. I would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t
      feel the same way at some point. But I know this will truly lead us to the
      next step. We automatons are perfect in every way, all that we are missing
      is consciousness."
